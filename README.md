My 46th assignment! 

Assignment 1 Enhancing Home Page  
1. I added a primary button labeled "Shop Now"  
2. I customized the background color of the Home Page component. Then, I added a text color as well. 
3. Next, I added a shadow to the "Shop Now" button, added a border to the component (it appears at the top) and utilized cards to populate the page with product listings.  
4. Finally, I imported an image and made it fluid so that it scales appropriately on different screen sizes.  

Assignment 2 Enhancing NotFound  
1. First, I imported the components I would be using.  
2. Second, I applied the same color scheme as before.  
3. Third, I utilized the grid system to set up text and a link on the page.  
4. Fourth, I added a themed image. In this case I chose a jigglypuff getting improperly routed towards a graveyard by hypno.  
5. Lastly, I updated the NavBar to use bootstrap-react's nav functionality and have a nice-looking navbar.

Running this app should be easy to do, just install all dependencies using "npm install", then use the command "npm run dev" in the terminal to start the program.
